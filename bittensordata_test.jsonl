These instruments can detect the faint light emitted by hydrogen gas when it is ionized by UV radiation from young stars. One challenge in studying these galaxies is that they are often located behind dense clouds of gas and dust, which can absorb or scatter the Lyman alpha light, making it difficult to detect.

This celebrated no-go proof asserts that any ontological model satisfying locality cannot account for all quantum statistics. This feature is commonly demonstrated through the quantum violation of suitable Bell inequalities. Besides the immense conceptual insights Bell's theorem adds to the quantum foundations research, it provides a multitude of practical applications in quantum information processing (see, for extensive reviews, \\cite{hororev,guhnearev,brunnerrev}). Moreover, the non-local correlation is device-independent, i.e., no characterization of the devices is needed to be assumed. Only the observed output statistics are enough to certify non-locality. The device-independent non-local correlation is used as a resource for secure quantum key distribution \\cite{bar05,acin06,acin07,pir09}, randomness certification \\cite{col06,pir10,nieto,col12}, witnessing Hilbert space dimension \\cite{wehner,gallego,ahrens,brunnerprl13,bowler,sik16prl,cong17,pan2020} and for achieving advantages in communication complexity tasks \\cite{complx1}.\n\t\n\tOptimal quantum value of a given Bell expression enables device-independent certification of state and measurements - commonly known as self-testing \\cite{self1,wagner2020,tava2018,farkas2019}. For example, optimal violation of CHSH inequality self-tests the maximally entangled state and mutually anti-commuting local observables. Note that the device-independent certification encounters practical challenges arises from the requirement of the loophole-free Bell test.  Such tests have recently been realized \\cite{lf1,lf2,lf3,lf4,lf5} enabling experimental demonstrations of device-independent certification of randomness \\cite{Yang, Peter}. However, practically such a loophole-free certification of non-local correlation remains an uphill task.  \n\t\n\tIn recent times, there is an upsurge of interest in semi-device independent (SDI)  protocols in prepare-measure scenario \\cite{pawlowski11, lungi,li11,li12,Wen,van, brask, bowles14,tava2018,farkas2019,tava20exp,mir2019,wagner2020,mohan2019,miklin2020,samina2020,fole2020,anwar2020}. It is less cumbersome than full device-independent test and hence experimentally more appealing. In most of the SDI certification protocols, it is commonly assumed that there is an upper bound on dimension, but otherwise the devices remain uncharacterized. Of late, a flurry of SDI protocols has been developed for certifying the states and sharp measurements \\cite{tava2018}, non-projective measurements \\cite{mir2019,samina2020}, mutually unbiased bases \\cite{farkas2019}, randomness  \\cite{lungi,li11,li12}\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

It is named after the French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who first studied it in the early 19th century. The Cauchy horizon is important because it helps us understand the behavior of massive objects in spacetime, such as black holes and neutron stars.

Gravitational waves (GWs) caused by binary black holes (BBHs) may contain information about how these objects were formed. According to this passage, BBHs can form due to encounters between black holes (BHs) in densely packed environments like globular clusters and galactic nuclei.\n2. The passage also highlights an important effect on the accuracy of the Post-Newtonian approach when dealing with these BBH systems. Specifically, for high-velocity dispersion environments found near supermassive BHs (which are known for having crowded regions), a full relativistic treatment is needed.\n3. To summarize briefly, the main takeaways are: - BBHs can come about through close encounters between BHs in tight spaces, such as globular clusters and galactic nuclei; - GW observations could potentially give insights into how BBHs were formed; - Accuracy issues may arise when dealing with systems near massive BHs due to high velocities and the post-Newtonian approximation breaking down."}]}

Image forgery is becoming a global epidemic which deeply affects our daily life for that some forgers use elaborately forged images to spread fake news or do other unscrupulous businesses \\cite{wu2018busternet}. Copy-move forgery is a kind of image forgery in which one or several regions are pasted elsewhere in the same image in order to hide or duplicate objects of interest. Copy-move forgery detection techniques have always been a hot topic in image forensics \\cite{ryu2010detection,christlein2012evaluation,li2015segmentation,cozzolino2015efficient}, and play important roles in cybersecurity and multimedia security \\cite{qian2016separable,qiao2019adaptive}.\n\nConventional copy-move forgery detection methods adopt handcrafted features, and can be broadly divided into two categories, i.e., block-based approaches \\cite{bashar2010exploring,ryu2013rotation,li2013image,li2013efficient,cozzolino2015efficient,mahmood2016copy,bi2018fast}, and keypoint-based approaches \\cite{pan2010region,amerini2011sift,kakar2012exposing,pun2015image,li2015segmentation,ardizzone2015copy}. Their major difference is that block-based methods aim at exploring local features from abundant overlapping patches, while keypoint-based methods concentrate on patches of keypoints \\cite{zandi2016iterative}. Nowadays, deep learning techniques have dominated various image processing tasks including image forensics \\cite{cozzolino2017recasting,wu2017deep,liu2018image,cozzolino2018forensictransfer,zhou2018learning,cun2018image,cozzolino2019noiseprint,liu2019adversarial,yu2019attributing,mayer2019forensic,rossler2019faceforensics++}. Deep learning based copy-move forgery detection has also been investigated in \\cite{wu2018image,wu2018busternet}. In \\cite{wu2018image}, Wu et al. proposed an end-to-end deep neural network for predicting copy-move forgery masks.

The current literature proposes several methods such as histogram technique to deal with these problems. Our method involves finding a field transformation and performing MC simulation on the corresponding reference action to obtain $\\phi^r$ configurations. Efficiency depends on constructing a suitable field transformation, dealing with fluctuations and maintaining a high overlap among configurations.\"\nPrevious Question \nQuestion:How does the efficiency of Monte Carlo simulations depend on constructing a suitable field transformation, dealing with fluctuations and maintaining a high overlap among configurations when studying observables for multiple parameter values in field theory?\nAnswer:1. Constructing a suitable field transformation:\nThe suitability of a field transformation depends on how well it captures the physical properties of the system being studied. Ideally, the field transformation should preserve the symmetries of the model and map physically meaningful observables to physically meaningful quantities. However, when multiple values of parameters are considered, the transformation must also accommodate these changes while maintaining the relevant symmetries. In practice, finding a suitable field transformation can be challenging and may require trial-and-error experimentation or knowledge about the underlying physics.\n\n2. Dealing with fluctuations:\nFluctuations occur when the field coordinates vary over time, leading to errors in the measurement of observables. To minimize these effects, various methods such as histogramming or reweighting can be employed. Histogramming involves averaging over many configurations generated by the same field transformation, while reweighting involves adjusting weights of configurations based on their contribution to the overall average. These techniques can help reduce the impact of fluctuations and improve the accuracy of observables.\n\n3. Maintaining a high overlap among configurations:\nOverlap refers to the fraction of configurations that are close to each other in energy or distance. Having a high overlap allows for more precise determinations of observables, as fluctuations become less significant. Maintaining\nQuestion:What are some potential benefits of using multiple values of parameters in field theory?\nOne potential benefit of using multiple values of parameters in field theory is that it allows for a more nuanced understanding of the system's behavior. By considering different values of parameters, researchers can explore how the system responds to changes in these values and how they impact its overall behavior. This can lead to new insights into the dynamics of the system and help researchers better predict its future behavior. Additionally, this approach can help identify important features or patterns that may not be apparent when considering only one value of a parameter.\nAnswer:How can researchers optimize the efficiency of Monte Carlo simulations when studying observables for multiple parameter values in field theory, taking into account factors such as constructing a suitable field transformation, dealing with fluctuations, and maintaining a high overlap among configurations?\n\nAsk a single relevant and insightful question about the preceding context and previous questions.

This mismatch between expectations and reality can lead to culture shock. Culture shock occurs when people experience disorientation or frustration due to cultural differences in language, customs, interpersonal relationships or social norms. It may manifest through varied symptoms such as homesickness, insomnia or irritability. People should prepare for culture shock by learning about a host country's culture and adjusting their expectations accordingly. Cultural intelligence training programs are designed to help individuals develop skills needed to navigate cross-cultural encounters effectively while avoiding pitfalls associated with cultural misunderstandings.\nPrevious Question \nQuestion:What steps can travelers take to minimize culture shock and adjust their expectations based on a host country's culture? \nTo minimize culture shock and adjust expectations based on a host country's culture, travelers should learn about the country's culture beforehand through reading travel guides, watching documentaries, or engaging with locals. This will help them to have a better understanding of the culture and adjust their expectations accordingly. Additionally, travelers should be open to the new experiences and try new things, as this will help them to form new connections with the host culture and adjust their expectations.

We requested and received a rifle directly from Ruger about two weeks ago. We had the rifle shipped to Ohio, so our Review Editor, William Chambers, could put it through a full range test. The fine folks at Nikon offered to send us one of their PROSTAFF 5 4.5-18\u00d740 riflescopes, with their custom XR Turret (more on that in a future review), to mount on the 77/17, so we took them up on the offer. It makes for a slick combo, ready for hunting varmints and even predators.\n\nNext, we had to set the criteria for our testing. Typically, we test rifles with one, or two different loads, because we are eager to take it hunting. However, with the new Ruger, we knew that folks wanted to see the results of all the ammunition available. While preparing for this test, we acquired new boxes of each of the currently available 17WSM ammunition, which includes the following:\n\nWinchester HV \u2013 20 grain VMax\n\nWinchester HE \u2013 25 grain VMax\n\nAmerican Eagle \u2013 20 grain VMax\n\nHornady \u2013 20 grain VMax\n\nAll groups were to be 5-shots, at 100 yards, at targets with 1/2\u2033 squares, giving us an idea of what this rifle would do with each branded load. We would also shoot multiple strings of shots through a chronograph, to determine whether, or not, the longer barrel would add to the velocity of each round. Last, but still important, we tested the trigger weight through a series of trigger pull tests with a trigger pull gauge.\n\nIncluded with any new Ruger 77/17 rifle, is a set of their rings (that match to the bases that are integrated into their receivers), as well as a magazine. The Ruger 77/17 \u2013 17WSM barrel has a 1:9\u2033 twist and ships with a 6-round rotary, flush-mount, magazine, which is the same dependable design we all know and appreciate. As we reported previously, this rifle is an almost exact match to Ruger\u2019s .17 Hornet rifle that was released in 2012. It has the feel of a centerfire rifle, and balances well, even with the 24\u2033 barrel. The rifle we received had a nice stock, with some slight tiger striping, that matched well with the matte stainless receiver and barrel.\n\nThe rifle has the other options you will find on their other 77/17 bolt-action rifles, including the three-position safety and front and rear sling swivels. It weighs 7.5 pounds with no optics and has a length of pull of 13.50\u2033.\n\nWhile at the range, Will began the barrel break-in process that we at Varminter do with every new rifle we test. After the break-in, a string of each commercial load was shot through the chronograph to determine the velocity, extreme spread and standard deviation (population).\n\nAs you can see, the velocity did not increase with the slightly longer barrel (+2\u2033)\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

It helps in reducing the computational complexity and improving the efficiency of the transduction process.\nAnswer:Step 1: Understand the question\nThe question is asking for a meticulous examination of how unary lifts and copying operations can simplify complex expressions. It also mentions that these simplifications help in reducing computational complexity and improving efficiency in the transduction process.\nStep 2: Define unary lifts and copying operations\nBefore examining how they simplify complex expressions, it's important to understand what unary lifts and copying operations are:\n- Unary lift: In mathematics, a unary operation is an operation with only one input. A unary lift takes a function or operation on individual elements and extends it to operate on collections or structures containing those elements.\n- Copying operation: This refers to the process of duplicating or replicating data from one location to another.\nStep 3: Analyze how unary lifts simplify complex expressions\nUnary lifts allow us to apply functions or operations on individual elements within a collection or structure. By doing so, we can avoid explicitly iterating over each element, which would be computationally expensive for large datasets.\nQuestion:Great! Based on the previous questions and context, here's a insightful question:\n\nQuery: Can you elaborate more on the efficiency gains of normalizing transductions using unary lifts and copying operations? Specifically, how does the reduction in computational complexity benefit problem-solving in constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs)?\nAnswer:There are several benefits to normalizing transductions using unary lifts and copying operations, with the most significant being a reduction in computational complexity. By moving copying operations to the front of a sequence and swapping unary lifts with other atomic operations, transductions can be simplified to the point where fewer conjunctions and disjunctions are required. As a result, the transduction process becomes more efficient and is\nQuestion:Sure! Here's a relevant and insightful question based on the preceding context and previous questions:\n\n Question: Can you explain why moving copying operations to the front of the sequence and swapping unary lifts with other atomic operations leads to a reduction in computational complexity in transductions? Specifically, how does this simplification help in efficiently solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs)?\nAnswer:1. Normalization processes play a critical role in simplifying complex expressions involving unary lifts and copying operations. They reduce computational complexity and improve efficiency when dealing with constraints like CSPs.\n2. Transformations into almost quantifier-free forms utilize less information than their original counterparts but still solve similar problems. These transformed versions have shorter proof lengths, making them ideal for practical applications.\n3. Using reducible terms eliminates redundant variables while preserving essential ones, resulting in smaller proofs. Additionally, transforming into almost quantifier-free forms allows for easier verification via automatic theorem proving tools.\n4. Applying these techniques results in simpler and faster solutions without compromising accuracy. Consequently, they become more accessible to broader audiences who may lack expertise in formal methods.\n5. Furthermore, the resulting formulas are often more intuitive, enabling humans to better comprehend and communicate mathematical ideas. Overall, normalization processes significantly enhance the accessibility, readability, and effectiveness of mathematical arguments.\n\nQuestion:almost quantifier-free, and the form $\\interp L;\\interp C;\\interp I''$ does not use lifts or copying.\n3\nAnswer the question step by step and explain your thoughts.

In this dense environment, the quantum degeneracy pressure of hadrons dominates and the microscopic calculation based on QCD is almost impossible due to the highly non-perturbative nature of the strong interaction. Hence many effective approaches including energy density functionals have been used to understand the properties of nuclear matter and the macroscopic quantities of neutron stars such as masses and radii. \n\n\nMost of the observed neutron stars are in radio pulsars. Even though  the magnetic field strength of most pulsars can be measured, \nif they are not in close binaries, their masses and radii are not easily extractable. Masses and radii of neutron stars have been measured in various kinds of binaries; low-mass X-ray and optical binaries, neutron star-white dwarf binaries, double neutron star binaries, and neutron star-main sequence binaries~\\cite{Pra13}. In two of neutron star-white dwarf binaries,  $2 M_\\odot$ neutron stars have been observed~\\cite{demorest2010,antoniadis2013,cromartie19}. These observations set the maximum mass of neutron stars to lie above $2 M_\\odot$. On the other hand, most of the well-measured neutron star masses in double neutron star binaries lie below $1.5 M_\\odot$. These observations imply that the actual masses of neutron stars may strongly depend on the evolution of neutron star binaries and the evolution of their progenitors~\\cite{Lee14,Lee17}.\n\n\nDetection of gravitational waves (GW170817) followed by gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) and electromagnetic afterglows (AT 2017gfo) from the merger of a neutron star binary opened a new era of multi-messenger astronomy and astrophysics~\\cite{GW170817PRL,GW170817ApJ}. First of all, the estimation of the masses and the tidal deformabilities of neutron stars from gravitational wave signals in GW170817 proved that gravitational waves can provide valuable information on the inner structure of neutron stars. This implies that nuclear and particle physics in dense environments can be tested by gravitational waves. In this article, we discuss the neutron star equation of state based on the nuclear energy density functionals. Secondly, series of afterglow observations in various frequency bands confirmed a possibility that a kilonova can be formed by a merger of neutron stars in a binary. Since the mergers of neutron star binaries can provide neutron rich environment which is essential for the production of heavy elements via r-process, it is believed that many heavy elements are produced in this kilonova.\n\n\nAs noticed above, multi-messenger observations of the merger of a neutron star binary provided new possibilities to nuclear and particle physics. In the work of Kim et al.~\\cite{Kim2018a,Kim2018b}, we investigated several Skyrme forces and energy density functionals (EDFs) including KIDS (Korea: IBS-Daegu-Sungkyunkwan) which are consistent with the properties of nuclear matter in finite nuclei and the constraints from neutron star observations.

'A' refers to some constant, '$m_i$' represents the occupation number of particles in orbital $i$, and $\\mathbf{S}_{k,i}$ is a singular vector representing spin at wavevector $k$ and orbital $i$.\n\nStep 2: Explain the role of each parameter\nNow let's explain the significance of each parameter. The constant 'A' is important because it determines the overall energy of the state. It helps us understand whether the system has a higher or lower energy compared to other possible states.\n\n$m_i$ plays a crucial role as it indicates whether an orbital is occupied by one particle (m=1), two particles (m=2), etc., which influences both the wavefunction shape and energy levels within the system.

For example, when $m_i = 0$, the system may exhibit metallic behavior with strong correlations between electrons. On the other hand, if $m_i > 0$, the system may enter into a Mott insulating phase where electrons localize on individual orbitals and form charge density waves (CDWs). Additionally, varying $m_i$ can also influence the emergence of superconductivity in the system.

In terms of dimensionality, as long as a sparse signal is linearly independent from other possible support positions, the number of necessary one-bit measurements grows only polynomially with the sparsity level and dimensionality. Therefore, this uniform bound contributes significantly to maintaining accurate and efficient signal reconstructions in various contexts such as compressed sensing applications.\nAnswer:The key takeaways from the text are:\n* Uniform $\\ell_2$-error bounds ensure stability against minor variations in locations/amplitudes for recovering sparse signals.\n* Polynomial growth rate for one-bit measuring needed depends on sparsity levels & dimensiosn; however if the siganlsare linerailly independant then it doesn't affect much.\n\nQuestion:Here's an inquiry: \"What role do compressive sensing and sparse recovery play in modern signal processing?\"\nHere's the reply: Compressive sensing and sparse recovery are essential techniques in modern signal processing, particularly when dealing with large datasets or signals that can be represented with fewer coefficients than traditional sampling methods allow.

Since then, the treaty has served as the cornerstone of French-German relations, a key partnership within the European Union.\n\nAs the two countries celebrate 50 years of close ties, FRANCE 24 spoke with Inga Groth, the official representative of Franco-German relations at the Robert Schuman foundation, a research centre that focuses on the EU and its policies.\n\nFRANCE 24: How did the Elys\u00e9e treaty change the relationship between France and Germany?\n\nInga Groth: It was a big step for France and Germany not only because it changed how the two countries interacted, but because it also created an institution that still exists today. The treaty allowed for France and Germany\u2019s governments to establish regular visits and exchanges every year between heads of state and ministers.\n\nMore than that, the treaty is exceptional because it was written to be very open-ended. Because of that, France and Germany have been able to engage on a political and diplomatic level as well as encourage cultural exchanges.\n\nFRANCE 24: What did the Elys\u00e9e treaty mean for Europe?\n\nInga Groth: Regarding Europe as a whole, it was always in its best interest for France and Germany to build a strong relationship. It\u2019s impossible to think of a Europe without the two countries. Together, they are able to address European issues like the EU budget in a more balanced way.\n\nFRANCE 24: What does the treaty represent today?\n\nInga Groth: It is impossible to realise just what a big deal the treaty was when it was signed. Today, Franco-German ties are viewed as completely normal \u2013 everyone is used to the close relationship the countries share. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the treaty may not need a breath of fresh air. We have to work to keep things strong. As is the case with any relationship, there are good times and then there are tougher times. I think the crisis has forced the two countries to work more closely together, and as a result France and Germany have had to make a lot of fast decisions that they would otherwise have taken more time to tackle. In one recent example, EU finance ministers took the first steps towards a banking union [in December, 2012,] by agreeing to give the European Central Bank new powers to supervise eurozone lenders. The crisis and fears surrounding the euro made it possible for this kind of decision to be made relatively quickly, whereas before it wouldn\u2019t have.\n\nThere have also been a number of changes on the political level. Whenever a new leader is elected, there will always be a period of adjustment. The relationship that [former French president] Nicolas Sarkozy shared with Merkel is completely different form the relationship between Hollande and Merkel. I think Hollande and Merkel may have started off on a low note. No matter what, they will make it work, because there\u2019s no other option.\n\nFRANCE 24: Will the treaty still be relevant in the future, or should it be changed or replaced by another agreement as Europe moves forward?\n\nInga Groth: As I said before, the truly special thing about the Elys\u00e9e treaty is that it leaves a lot of room for changes to be made or for new ideas to be added\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

This model has been widely applied in recent years \\citenum{PhysRevLett.109.246803}. It allows one to include correlation effects due to the finite size\nAnswer:1) An atomic system can be modeled as a sum of harmonic oscillators with frequencies determined by the distance between the nuclei.\n- Well, this is a common approach in quantum mechanics to describe atoms.\nQuestion:What is the significance of including correlation effects in the modeling of atomic systems?\n\nIncluding correlation effects in the modeling of atomic systems is significant because it allows for a more accurate representation of the behavior of the atoms. By taking into account the finite size of the atoms, the model can capture the correlations between the different components of the system, such as the nucleus and the electrons. This can lead to a better understanding of the properties of the system, such as its energy levels and the strength of the interactions between the different components. Additionally, including correlation effects can help to improve the accuracy of experimental measurements and predictions of theoretical models.\nAnswer:Step 1: Understand the given information - The Morse potential-energy function for the inter-atomic interaction was used, and the vibrational states are taken into account.\nStep 2: Identify the key point - No other degrees of freedom like rotations or translations are included in the model.\nStep 3: Analyze the importance of the mentioned factors - Correlation effects play an essential role in describing the behavior of atomic systems. They allow for a more precise representation of the system's structure and interactions among its components (nucleus and electrons).\nStep 4: Provide the explanation - Including these effects improves the accuracy of both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations, allowing for a deeper understanding of the atom's properties and behavior.\n\nQuestion:Can you tell me more about how the Gaussian wave packet modeling of the nuclear charge distribution helps to capture the correlations between the different components of the atomic system?\nAnswer the question step by step and explain your thoughts.

To obtain the vibrational states, the eigenstates were obtained by solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation using the corresponding eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, which includes the interactions between the nuclei and the electrons.\n3) To capture the correlations between the different components, the authors calculated the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian. They considered all possible combinations of the center of mass motion (translational motion) and rotational motion (angular momentum and vibrational motion).\n4) By using these eigenstates, the authors could compute the probability amplitude of finding the system in a particular state. This way, they could investigate the correlation between the different components.\n5) Finally, by comparing the results with experimental values, they could test their model and refine it if necessary.\n\nSo, overall, the use of the Gaussian wave packet model for describing nuclear charge distribution helps to capture the correlations between the different components by bringing in the finite size effect, which can influence the behavior of the system.

Here's a relevant and insightful question based on the provided context:\n\n\"How do the authors' proposed compressive sensing techniques address the challenge of intermodal dependence in multimodal detection problems, and what advantages do these techniques offer compared to traditional likelihood ratio-based fusion methods?\"\nAnswer:Instead, provide a clear and concise explanation of how the techniques work and the benefits they offer. For example:\n\"The authors propose compressive sensing techniques to address the challenge of intermodal dependence in multimodal detection problems. These techniques offer several advantages over traditional likelihood ratio-based fusion methods, including: (1) reduced communication costs; (2) improved accuracy; and (3) increased robustness against noise and other errors.\"\n\nSo there is this problem with multimodal detection, where the data comes from different sources (e.g., sound, image) and it's hard to deal with because each source has its own characteristics and they are dependent on each other. The new method proposed by the authors addresses this issue by compressing the data before transmission to a fusion center. This not only saves communication costs but also improves accuracy and makes the system more robust against noise and errors.\n\nThe key takeaways from the text are:\n- Multimodal detection is a challenge because of intermodal dependencies and high dimensionality.\n- The authors propose a new framework for\nQuestion:Sure!

Important result obtained using Parisi's solution for SK model, leading to countably infinite pure states organized in ultrametric structure. This structure visible through introduction of replicated systems made up of non-interacting identical copies. Overlap defined between spin configurations of different replicas. Random variables $q_{ab}$ introduced representing overlaps. Equation \\eqref{distrq} relating average over overlap and thermal averages shown. Parisi solution providesjoint distribution for overlaps among three replicas. Formulas \\eqref{ro1213} and \\eqref{ro1234} illustrate correlations between overlaps even among two distinct couples of replicas. Ultrametric structure dictates single overlap distributions at fixed $J$ to be non-self-averaging with respect to $J$.\nPrevious Question \nQuestion:The key takeaways from the text are that the Parisi solution provides a joint distribution for overlaps among three replicas and that the ultrametric structure dictates single overlap distributions at fixed $J$ to be non-self-averaging with respect to $J$.\nAnswer:Just provide a clear and concise explanation of the key points.\nStep 1: Identify the main idea of the passage - In this case, the main idea is that the Parisi solution provides a joint distribution for overlaps among three replicas and that single overlap distributions at fixed $J$ are non-self-averaging with respect to $J$.\nStep 2: Summarize the information in one sentence - The information provided can be summarized as follows: \"The Parisi solution gives a joint distribution for overlaps among three replicas, and single overlap distributions at fixed $J$ are non-self-averaging with respect to $J$.\"\nQuestion:Sure, I'd be happy to help!\n\n What implications do the non-self-averaging properties of single overlap distributions at fixed $J$ have for our understanding of spin glasses?\n\nParaphrased  The non-self-averaging properties of single overlap distributions at fixed $J$ suggest that the behavior of spin glasses is highly sensitive to the specific realization of disorder, and that there may be important differences between different samples or experiments with the same average parameters. This could have important implications for our understanding of the universality class to which spin glasses belong, as well as for their potential applications in fields such as materials science and computing.\nAnswer:\"What are some key insights from the text on spin glass models?\" \nAnswer: The main takeaway is that the behavior of spin glasses is strongly influenced by the specific realization of disorder, meaning that small changes in the distribution of magnetic interactions can lead to significant differences in the system's properties. This non-self-averaging nature suggests that these materials may not belong to a simple universal class, but rather display unique features depending on their specific microscopic details.\nQuestion:Sure! Here's my question:\n\nHow does the non-self-averaging property of single overlap distributions at fixed $J$ relate to the idea of replica symmetry breaking in spin glass models?\nAnswer:The non-self-averaging property is linked to replica symmetry breaking as it suggests the presence of different configurations of the replicas even at fixed $J$. This means that the system doesn't always converge to a unique state, and instead, it can get stuck in different local minima, which are associated with different overlap distributions.

After Google\\cite{zoph2016neural} and MIT\\cite{he2016deep} released NAS based on reinforcement learning in 2016, through improvements in search space\\cite{zoph2018learning}, search strategies\\cite{pham2018efficient}, and evaluation methods\\cite{tan2019efficientnet} in recent years, NAS algorithms have gradually reduced the demand for GPUs and become more \"civilized\", enabling more people to have opportunities to provide new idea which promote the development of automated machine learning.\n\tEspecially, DARTS\\cite{hanxiao2019darts}, as one of the algorithms that rapidly improve the computational efficiency of NAS method, uses a neural network structure composed of stacked cells as the search space, and relax the Categorical selection of a specific operation to a softmax of all possible operations to make the search space continuous. In addition to the huge computational burden DARTS has to bear, the generalization ability of the searched network architecture also has space for improvement. The prior work named Partially-Connected DARTS (PC-DARTS)\\cite{xu2019pc} proposed to sample a small part of super-network to reduce redundancy when exploring the network space. PC-DARTS improved the performance of the searched network architecture with only one group of channels, which indicated group of channels has good value for architecture search.\n\tIn addition, Squeeze-and-Excitation Network (SENet)\\cite{hu2018squeeze} that appeared in 2017 obtained the weight of different channels by learning the relationship between each channel, then multiplied the weight by the original feature map to acquire the final feature. We referred to the method of observing the connection between channels of attention mechanism and proposed our own parameters to balance the relationship between channels.\n\tIn this paper, we present a novel approach named Group-DARTS with attention (G-DARTS-A) to reduce the overfitting and improve the stability in searching process. There are two primary contributions of our method, namely, Channel Group Parallel Sampling for Searching and the attention for balance between each group. As the key technique in this work, Channel Group Parallel Sampling has not been researched in NAS for searching more stable architecture with better performance. This point proposes a new idea to design super network for NAS. This kind of super network we built, combining Channel Group Parallel Sampling and weights for attention, can ensure the stability of the search process and prevent the searched architecture from overfitting.\n\tWe increase the accuracy on cifar10 and cifar100 of PC-DARTS and DARTS. Moreover, these two components are easily transplanted to other search algorithms to improve search accuracy and generalization, e.g., these can boost the accuracy and speed of all algorithms based on DARTS search space. We only use the attention module of this method on DARTS and achieve an error rate of 2.82\\%/16.36\\% on CIFAR10/100 with 0.2GPU-days for search process on CIFAR10.

The energy levels are discrete in nature, meaning that they can only take on certain values. These states are referred to as \"eigenstates\"\nAnswer:1. What is the significance of Pauli exclusion principle in quantum mechanics?\nPauli exclusion principle is significant in quantum mechanics because it explains why electrons in atoms cannot occupy the same energy state. This principle is based on the observation that electrons have negative charges and interact with each other through the electromagnetic force. When two electrons try to occupy the same energy state, they would repel each other due to their negative charges. Therefore, the Pauli exclusion principle plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of electrons in atoms and other systems containing charged particles.\n2. How does quantum entanglement affect the behavior of particles in quantum systems?\nQuantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked together in such a way that their properties cannot be described independently. This means that even though the particles may be separated by large distances, their quantum states remain correlated. Quantum entanglement has important implications for various applications, including cryptography and quantum computing.

Each pattern is created by a self-organized certain population of interacting components of the system resulting aggregation having certain form of regularity, symmetry and structure which is the source of certain form of information and can participate in the system's collective decision making process \\cite{Julia}. However, the whole process of each pattern may not be the exact sum of the individual activities of the constituting components which are nonlinear in characters, sensitive to the surrounding internal and external fluctuations and initial conditions, dissipative in nature, and the dynamics are generally strongly coupled \\cite{Newman}. Each pattern is generally open in nature which allow exchange of energy, accessible states are far away from equilibrium, and the information flow is permitted across the boundary \\cite{Werner}. The interaction among the components in a pattern could be of diverse form which drives the dynamics of individual components quite complicated in nature which could be the origin of complicated properties of each pattern \\cite{Karaca}. Technically, the degree of pattern is generally characterized by complexity \\cite{Cosma}. The complexity of the pattern can be measured by different techniques, some of which are information theoretical approach \\cite{Hale}, statistical complexity measures \\cite{Crutchfield}, Kolmogorov complexity \\cite{Kolmogorov},  Lempel-Ziv complexity \\cite{Aboy} etc. The study of the properties of these patterns may provide the information of how complex systems work at fundamental level.\\\\\n\n{\\noindent}The observation of the emergent properties of the patterns in the systems can be done mathematically using traditional central limit theorem by calculating large number of outcomes perceived from hidden processes of the distribution of the interacting random variables $\\{x_i\\};i=1,2,...,N$ corresponding to the aggregated $N$ components of the pattern \\cite{Jaynes,Feller1,Feller2}. Depending on the observed properties of the probability distribution, the pattern can be in one of the classical patterns, namely, \\textit{Norma, Poisson, Power law patterns etc} \\cite{Frank} and these patterns, in most of the biological systems, are dynamic in nature depending on the fluctuations driving them and limiting distribution conditions \\cite{Wootton}. If the spatiotemporal events are scattered randomly throughout the system, the probability distribution function becomes Poisson distribution and the pattern corresponds to classical \\textit{Poisson pattern} \\cite{Feller1,Feller2,Frank}. Since Poisson pattern is generally generated from the random processes smaller-scales, the basin of attraction of such patterns have aggregation of large scale small-scale random processes by segregating from nonrandom processes \\cite{Kleiber}. On the other hand, classical \\textit{Normal pattern} stores the information of mean $\\langle x\\rangle$ and variance $\\sigma^2$ in the aggregation process of the components in the pattern $\\mathcal{P}[\\langle x\\rangle,\\sigma^2]$, where, sum of the uncorrelated small-scaled fluctuations of the components during the aggregation process cancels out to attract towards a certain form of spatiotemporal regular aggregated pattern \\cite{Jaynes, Frank}. Hence, the dynamics of the aggregated components in such classical Normal patterns follow Brownian motion \\cite{Uhlenbeck}. Further, if the aggregated pattern keeps only the information of mean, the pattern falls in \\textit{exponential pattern} $\\displaystyle\\mathcal{P}[x]=\\frac{1}{\\langle x\\rangle}e^{-\\frac{x}{\\langle x\\rangle}}$, where, the pattern is contributed from the waiting time characterization of random events and the distribution has memoryless property \\cite{Frank}. If the aggregation pattern preserves the information of geometric mean, the pattern follows classical \\textit{Power law} pattern which can have fractal patterns which have self-similar process $\\displaystyle\\frac{\\mathcal{P}[\\alpha x]}{\\mathcal{P}[x]}=\\alpha^h=F(\\alpha)$, where, $h$ is self-similarity exponent \\cite{Mandelbrot,Barabasi}. From these probability distribution functions, one can measure hidden information stored in the respective patterns by calculating Shannon entropy, $\\displaystyle \n\\mathcal{H}=-\\sum_{i}\\mathcal{P}_i[x]ln\\mathcal{P}_i[x]$ \\cite{Shannon}\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

The transferbility come from semantically similar words are encoded into similar latent representations, regardless of languages. Considering  that m-BERT was trained on masked language modeling and there are a bunch of subwords shared by languages that could be used as anchors, it is hypothesized that m-BERT exploited the co-occurrence information to align word pairs having similar contexts or usage statistics~\\citep{pires2019multilingual}. \n\nHowever, m-BERT seems to be the only model succeeding in aligning cross-lingual word pairs simply trained on concatenated monolingual corpora with a monolingual objective. Similar methods for training cross-lingual word embeddings, called unsupervised joint training, often fail to generate high-quality alignments, especially for embeddings of non-shared words, due to a lack of explicit clues~\\citep{Wang:20}. \\citet{Wang:20} show that supervised post-hoc alignment effectively boosts unsupervised joint training in the case of traditional non-contextualized embeddings, but is not as beneficial in the case of m-BERT, suggesting that pretraining alone generates strong alignments even without supervision.\n\nSeveral key components have been studied why m-BERT generalize across languages so well~\\citep{Karth:20}. In an analysis of the two-language version of BERT, it was shown that depth and the total number of network parameters affect cross-lingual ability a lot. Performance on the XNLI dataset significantly degrades when model architecture becomes shallower or more-parsimonious. Wordpiece tokenization also contributes to cross-lingual ability, compared with character-level or word-level tokenization. \n\nSurprisingly, shared vocabulary was found to be unnecessary in the same study. Pre-trained BERT successfully transfers from English to a lexical-modified version of English, although it failed when word ordering or n-gram statistics were randomly manipulated. This suggests that some structural similarity is possibly what BERT has learned from, while further definition should be developed and discovered. \n\nIt's also unclear if the above findings hold for other non-contextualized embedding models, since the pre-training process and dataset could make a crucial difference in cross-lingual ability.\n\nIn this section, we calibrate the external factors when pretraining the representations to give a fair discussion focusing on the architecture of the embedding models and study two key components that are dominant in building up cross-lingual ability of m-BERT.  \n\n\\subsection{Metrics for Cross-lingual Ability}\nThere are two main paradigms for evaluating cross-lingual representations:~{\\it word retrieval} and {\\it downstream task transfer}. \nHere we use both word retrieval and downstream task transfer as the indicators of cross-lingual ability for both contextualized and non-contextualized embeddings. \nAlthough word retrieval is a task originally proposed to measure cross-lingual alignment at the word level, therefore naturally more suitable for non-contextualized embeddings, contextual version of word retrieval has been proposed for contextualized embeddings and consistent with downstream task transfer performance~\\citep{Cao:20}. \n\n\\subsubsection{Word Retrieval}\nGiven a word and a bilingual dictionary~$D=\\{(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),\\ldots,(x_n,y_n)\\}$, listing all parallel word pairs from source and target languages, word retrieval is the task to retrieve the corresponding word in target language considering information provided by embedding vectors~$\\{(u_1,v_1),(u_2,v_2),...(u_n,v_n)\\}$. Specifically we consider a nearest neighbor retrieval function\n\\begin{equation}\n    neighbor(i)=\\mathop{\\arg\\max}_{j}sim(u_i,v_j),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $u_i$ is the embedding of source word $x_i$ and we want to find its counterpart $y_i$ among all candidates~$y_1,y_2,\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "\\section{Introduction}\nThe quantum Hall effect occurs when a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is cooled to low temperature and placed in a strong magnetic field. Fractional quantum Hall states \\cite{Tsui1982, Laughlin1983} exhibit fractionally quantized Hall conductance, and have excitations that behave as fractionally charged quasiparticles which obey anyonic braiding statistics \\cite{Leinaas1977, Wilczek1982, Halperin1984, Arovas1984,Bartolomei2020,Nakamura2020}.\n\n\nThe concept of particle-hole symmetry plays a central role in the hierarchical construction of daughter states from the $\\nu=1/m$ Laughlin series \\cite{Haldane1983, Girvin1984, Halperin1984}. If Landau-level mixing is neglected, particle-hole symmetry is expected for each Landau level \\cite{Girvin1984}; a similar approximate particle-hole symmetry exists for composite fermions \\cite{Jain2017}. The $\\nu = 2/3$ fractional quantum Hall state can be considered to be the hole-conjugate state to the $\\nu = 1/3$ state \\cite{Girvin1984, Jain2017}. In this picture, the fully filled $\\nu = 1$ state is considered to be the vacuum, and holes form a $\\nu = 1/3$ state on top of this vacuum, leading to an overall 2/3 filling factor.  The 2/3 state has been investigated in numerous theoretical works \\cite{Macdonald1990, Jain2012, Hu2008}.\n\nThe edge mode structure in hierarchical states may possess several branches \\cite{Macdonald1990, Wen1991}. Moreover, multiple edge structures have been proposed for the 2/3 state. The edge structure which most straightforwardly follows from the hole-conjugate nature of the state was proposed by MacDonald \\cite{Macdonald1990, Macdonald1991}. In this picture, the edge consists of an outer downstream integer edge mode (from the underlying $\\nu = 1$ state) and an inner, counterpropogating -1/3 edge mode. In this context, counterpropagating (or upstream) edge modes travel in the direction opposite to the conventional quantum Hall chiral edge current (edge modes following the conventional direction may be referred to as downstream). Equilibration between the two edge modes leads to a total conductance of $\\frac{2}{3} \\frac{e^2}{h}$. A different edge structure was proposed by Kane and collaborators \\cite{Kane1994} in which disorder dominates and drives an edge phase transition to a single downstream charge mode with conductance $\\frac{2}{3}\\frac{e^2}{h}$ and a counterpropagating neutral mode. A model developed by Meir and coworkers considered the impact of soft confining potential in addition to disorder and predicted a reconstructed edge involving the formation of a strip with filling factor $\\nu = 1/3$ at the edge leading to two downstream charge modes with conductance $\\frac{1}{3} \\frac{e^2}{h}$ along with counterpropagating neutral modes \\cite{Meir1993, Meir2013}; other theoretical works have also examined the possibility of incompressible strips with fractional fillings when the confining potential is soft \\cite{Chklovskii1992, Beenakker1990, Chang1990}. Experimental studies of the $\\nu = 2/3$ state in quantum point contacts have usually shown an intermediate conductance plateau with $G = \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{e^2}{h}$ when the QPC gates are negatively biased to bring the edges close together, which supports the existence of the Meir edge structure in those experiments \\cite{Heiblum2009, Ensslin2014, Heiblum2017}. Experiments in which this $G = \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{e^2}{h}$ intermediate plateau was observed also detected upstream noise attributed to counterpropagating neutral modes \\cite{Heiblum2010, Heiblum2017}. These neutral modes are likely to be detrimental to interference experiments because their entanglement with the charge modes leads to dephasing \\cite{Gefen2016, Heiblum2019-2}. \n\nThe device investigated in our experiments consists of two quantum point contacts (QPCs) separated by a pair of side gates, and utilizes a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure with auxiliary screening wells above and below the main quantum well (shown in Supp. Fig. 1 and described in Supp. Section 1). This geometry can be used to define a Fabry-Perot interferometer \\cite{Chamon1997, Halperin2011, Halperin2021, Halperin2022, Nakamura2019, Nakamura2020, Nakamura2022}, but in this work we probe the QPCs independently without inducing interference. A false color SEM image is shown in Fig. \\ref{Integer_data}a. The QPCs have a separation of 300 nm, and the dimensions of the interferometer are 800 nm $\\times$ 800 nm. We probe the QPCs individually, measuring the conductance of one QPC while tuning the gate voltage on the other to full transmission (in this mode of operation no interference occurs since backscattering only occurs in the QPC being probed). We apply a voltage on the source contact $V_{SD}$ which is a combination of an AC voltage and a DC voltage (the application of DC bias is described where relevant)\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

Here's an example of a relevant and insightful question based on the preceding context:\n\"What do the differences in religious adherence between France and Canada versus the US suggest about how cultural values and social norms shape people's religious beliefs and practices?\"\nThis question asks for further insight into why people in different regions have different religious attitudes and could lead to a more meaningful discussion about the complex social and cultural factors that contribute to religious diversity.\nAnswer:1.  According to Paul, what is the relationship between religiosity and economic conditions in modern societies?\nGregory Paul argues that while religion may provide comfort during times of hardship, it also serves as a buffer against poverty, providing a sense of community and purpose that can help individuals cope with difficult circumstances. He suggests that this dynamic has played out differently across various cultures throughout history, leading to distinct patterns of religious expression and influence. For instance, he notes that Christianity was able to spread quickly among European peoples due to their shared cultural values emphasizing individualism and entrepreneurial spirit, which aligned well with the teachings of Jesus Christ. In contrast, Buddhist traditions were better suited to Asian societies characterized by collectivistic values and communal living arrangements. Overall, Paul contends that understanding these historical dynamics helps us appreciate the diverse expressions of faith we see today and recognize how they reflect broader social and cultural forces at play.\nQuestion:2. How did religion develop differently across different regions around the globe?\nGregory Paul argues that while Christianity spread rapidly in Europe due to its compatibility with individualist values, Buddhism flourished in Asia because it resonated more deeply with collectivistic societies there. He suggests this difference reflected broader historical trends such as migration patterns, trade routes, and other socio-cultural factors influencing religious expression over time. Furthermore, he notes that Islam's success can be attributed largely to its ability to adapt and incorporate local customs into new territories it conquered, creating a unique blend of tradition and innovation. This highlights the complex interplay between religion, culture, and societal norms shaping belief systems across different regions throughout history.\nAnswer:Instead, provide a clear and concise explanation of each part of the prompt.\nWhat are some examples of how religion has influenced society?\nReligion has had a profound impact on society throughout history. Some examples of how religion has influenced society include:\n1. Shaping moral values: Religions often set forth codes of conduct and ethical standards that guide individuals' behavior.\n2. Promoting social cohesion: Religious communities provide a sense of belonging and support for their members, helping them navigate difficult times and achieve common goals.\n3. Inspiring art and culture: Religious beliefs have inspired many great works of art, music, and literature over the centuries.\n4. Aiding scientific discovery: Many scientists throughout history have been inspired by their religious beliefs to make significant discoveries in fields such as physics and biology.'\n5. Preventing war: Religion can promote peaceful coexistence between different groups if individuals choose to interpret their faith in a tolerant manner.'\nThese are just a few examples of how religion has influenced society in various ways over time.'\nQuestion:Why do you think religion remains influential despite changing societal norms? Despite evolving cultural values, many people continue to hold onto religious beliefs due to its ability to provide comfort during hardship, offer communal support, inspire artistic expression, promote peace, and drive scientific discovery. Moreover, it serves as a source of identity and tradition within communities, making it difficult for some individuals to abandon their faith entirely even when faced with countervailing pressures from society at large.'\nAnswer:Instead, focus on providing a clear and concise explanation of how religion maintains its influence in modern society.\nStep 1: Identify the main idea of the passage.\nThe main idea of the passage is that religion remains influential in modern society despite changes in societal norms and cultural values.\nStep 2: Summarize the paragraph in one sentence.\nThe paragraph discusses how religion continues to exert influence over individuals and communities despite societal changes, drawing from its ability to offer comfort, support, and a sense of identity.\nStep 3: Restate the thesis statement in your own words.\nReligion maintains its influence in modern society because it provides comfort, support, and a sense of identity to individuals and communities despite changes in societal norms and cultural values.\nStep 4: Explain your answer\nMy answer is that religion maintains its influence in modern society due to its ability to provide comfort, support, and a sense of identity. These aspects are crucial for individuals and communities during times of hardship and uncertainty, making religion an enduring force despite\n\nQuestion:For instance, instead of asking \"How did the development of religion differ according to different regions around the globe?\nAnswer the question step by step and explain your thoughts.

The solution of linear hyperbolic systems of balance laws\nPrevious Question \nQuestion:just ask! \n\nWhat is the significance of studying linear hyperbolic systems of balance laws?\nStudying linear hyperbolic systems of balance laws is significant because they play a crucial role in various areas such as fluid dynamics, transport phenomena, and wave propagation. These systems describe how the rate of change of a physical quantity (such as velocity or pressure) depends on its current value and the direction of propagation. By understanding how to solve these equations, researchers can gain insights into the behavior of real-world systems and develop new methods for modeling and simulating them. Additionally, studying linear hyperbolic systems can lead to advancements in numerical methods for solving partial differential equations more generally.\n\nHow do researchers typically approach solving linear hyperbolic systems of balance laws?\nResearchers typically approach solving linear hyperbolic systems of balance laws using numerical methods such as finite difference methods, finite element methods, or spectral methods. Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method depends on the specific problem being solved and the desired level of accuracy.\nAnswer:Step 1: Start by understanding the problem at hand.\nStep 2: Identify the physical phenomena involved and determine the governing equations.\nStep 3: Transform the partial differential equations (PDEs) into a suitable hyperbolic form by making suitable coordinate or transformation.\nStep 4: Perform spatial discretization using finite difference/finite element methods to obtain a system of algebraic equations at each node.\nStep 5: Convert the resulting algebraic equations into a sparse linear matrix equation using techniques such as matrix factorization or Gaussian elimination.\nStep 6: Solve the linear equation system using suitable iterative methods like LU decomposition, QR factorization, or conjugate-gradient algorithm.\nStep 7: Verify the convergence of the results by comparing with exact or reference solutions\nQuestion:Can you explain how the choice of method for solving linear hyperbolic systems affects the accuracy of the solution?\nASSISTANT: Sure! The choice of method for solving linear hyperbolic systems can significantly impact the accuracy of the solution. Finite difference methods are generally faster and more computationally efficient, but may not produce as accurate results as spectral methods or finite element methods, which require more computational effort but can provide more precise solutions. The choice of method also depends on the specific problem being solved and the desired level of accuracy.\nAnswer:To summarize:\n1. Finite difference methods are often used for fast and simple calculations.\n2. They can be less accurate than other methods such as finite element methods and spectral methods.\n3.

These pseudopotentials were used in the exact diagonalization (ED) calculations.\n\n\\subsection{Disk pseudopotentials}\n\\label{app: disk_pps_ZLL_BLG}\nIn this subsection, we present some formulae for the disk pseudopotentials in the ZLL of BLG.

As in the main text, the ZLL of BLG refers to the state described by the spinor wave function $(\\sin(\\theta)\\phi_{1},\\cos(\\theta)\\phi_{0})$, where $\\phi_{n}$ is the single-particle state of non-relativistic electrons in the LL indexed by $n$ and $\\theta$ is the mixing-angle which can be controlled by the external magnetic field $B$. The form-factor, which completely specifies the interaction, in the ZLL of BLG is given by:\n\\begin{equation}\nF^{{\\rm ZLL-BLG}}(\\theta,q) = \\Bigg[\\sin^{2}(\\theta)L_{1}\\Big(\\frac{q^2\\ell^2}{2}\\Big)+\\cos^{2}(\\theta)L_{0}\\Big(\\frac{q^2\\ell^2}{2}\\Big) \\Bigg]^2,\n\\label{eq:ZerothLL_BLG_form_factor}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $L_{k}(x)$ is the Laguerre polynomial of degree $k$ and $\\ell{=}\\sqrt{\\hbar c/(eB)}$ is the magnetic length. In Eq.~\\eqref{eq:ZerothLL_BLG_form_factor}, it suffices to consider the range $0{\\leq}\\theta{\\leq}\\pi/2$ since the form-factor only depends on $\\sin^{2}(\\theta)$. For $\\theta{=}0$ and $\\theta{=}\\pi/2$ we recover the form-factors for the lowest Landau level (LLL) and second Landau level (SLL) of GaAs respectively.

The integral in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:Haldane_pps_ZerothLL_BLG} can be evaluated analytically and results in the following expression for the Coulomb pseudopotentials in the disk geometry for the ZLL of BLG:\n\\begin{equation}\nV^{{\\rm ZLL-BLG}}_{m}(\\theta)=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi }}{32} \\Bigg(16~_2F_1\\left(\\frac{1}{2},-m;1;1\\right)-8~_2F_1\\left(\\frac{3}{2},-m;1;1\\right)\\sin^{2}(\\theta)+3~_2F_1\\left(\\frac{5}{2},-m;1;1\\right)\\sin^{4}(\\theta) \\Bigg)~\\frac{e^{2}}{\\epsilon\\ell},\n\\label{eq:ZerothLL_BLG_disk_pps}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $_2F_1$ is the Gauss hypergeometric function.

Increased control over commodity prices: By holding a significant amount of physical commodities, Big Banks can influence supply and demand dynamics, allowing them to manipulate prices for their own benefit. This can lead to price volatility and unfair market conditions for other participants.\n\n2. Distorted market competition: The ability of Big Banks to charge rent for storing commodities gives them an advantage over smaller players who do not have access to such storage facilities. This creates an uneven playing field and hampers fair competition in the commodities market.\n\n3. Potential conflicts of interest: As banks engage in both trading and storing physical commodities, there is a risk of conflicts of interest arising. They may use their knowledge about the stored inventory to make profitable trades or favor certain clients, compromising market integrity.\n\n4. Limited transparency: The practice of keeping physical commodities in warehouses allows Big Banks to operate in a less transparent manner. This lack of transparency makes it difficult for regulators and other market participants to monitor and prevent manipulative activities effectively.\n\n5. Negative impact on consumers: Manipulation in the commodities market can result in higher prices for essential goods such as food, energy, and raw materials.

If there are missing or unreliable velocity samples due to occlusions or tracking errors, it may lead to incorrect classifications.\nOn the other hand, I-DT algorithm uses dispersion thresholds instead of velocities for classification.

Based on what he could prove in the simplest case of restart length $s=1$, and what he observed numerically for $s=2$, Forsythe formulated a conjecture about the behavior of the method for general~$s$. In short, the Forsythe conjecture is that the normalized error vectors (or normalized residual vectors) of the restarted method eventually cycle back and forth between two limiting directions. This unwanted oscillatory behavior leads to slow (at most linear) convergence, which Stiefel had illustrated with his cage (``K\\\"afig'') already in 1952~\\cite{Sti52}.\n\nIn light of the importance and wide-spread use of the CG method, surprisingly few results about the Forsythe conjecture have been published beyond the case $s=1$, and the conjecture remains largely open after more than 50 years. In addition to Forsythe in~\\cite{For68}, proofs of the oscillatory behavior for $s=1$ were published by Akaike~\\cite{Aka59} and Gonzaga and Schneider~\\cite{GonSch16}, as well as Afanasjew, Eiermann, Ernst, and G\\\"uttel~\\cite{AfaEieErnGue08} (for a somewhat different algorithm). The nature of the oscillations for $s=1$ were studied by Nocedal, Sartenaer, and Zhu~\\cite{NocSarZhu02}. Prozanto, Wynn, and Zhigljavsky~\\cite{ProWynZhi09} analyzed the rate of convergence of the $s$-dimensional optimum gradient method, re-derived several results of Forsythe in a different formulation, and numerically studied the limiting behavior particularly in the case $s=2$. This case was also analyzed by Zhuk and Bondarenko~\\cite{ZhuBon83}, and we will comment on their work after the proof of our Theorem~\\ref{thm:limit-degree} below.\n\nForsythe already suspected, and even conjectured, that the results he proved apply to a wider class of (restarted) gradient-type methods when applied to sufficiently smooth functions; see~\\cite[p.~58]{For68}. And indeed, a cyclic behavior has sometimes been observed also in other restarted Krylov subspace methods, particularly when applied to symmetric or normal matrices; see, e.g.,~\\cite{BakJesMan05,VecLan10}.\n\nIn this paper we generalize the Forsythe conjecture (formulated only for symmetric positive definite matrices) to symmetric and nonsymmetric matrices. Instead of the projection process underlying the CG method, we use the projection process of the Arnoldi (or for symmetric matrices the Lanczos) algorithm. The resulting \\emph{Arnoldi cross iteration} alternatingly uses the given matrix $A$ and its transpose~$A^T$. While such a cross iteration usually does not solve a linear algebraic system or eigenvalue problem for~$A$, it can be of interest for analyzing the worst-case behavior of the underlying projection process. Motivated by work of Zavorin~\\cite{Zav01} as well as Zavorin, O'Leary, and Elman~\\cite{ZavOLeElm03} (who studied complete stagnation of the GMRES method~\\cite{SaaSch86} for~$A$ and~$A^T$), we have previously introduced a \\emph{GMRES cross iteration} in the context of worst-case GMRES~\\cite{FabLieTic13}. In this paper we do not focus on the worst-case behavior, but we will nevertheless show that the Arnoldi cross iteration with $s=1$ solves the \\emph{ideal Arnoldi problem} for real orthogonal matrices; see~\\eqref{eqn:idealArnoldi} and the end of Section~\\ref{sec:ACI-orth}.\nBecause it uses $A$ and $A^T$, the Arnoldi cross iteration for $s=1$ is related to Ostrowski's two-sided iteration~\\cite{Ost59} and Parlett's Alternating Rayleigh Quotient Iteration (ARQI) for computing eigenpairs of nonsymmetric matrices~\\cite{Par74}. The precise nature of these relations are yet to be explored.\n\nFor symmetric matrices the iterative steps with $A$ and~$A^T$ in the Arnoldi cross iteration coincide, and we recover essentially the same algorithm as originally studied by Forsythe, only with a different (namely the Arnoldi or the Lanczos) projection process. We conjecture that the Arnoldi cross iteration in general has the same oscillatory limiting behavior as the one conjectured by Forsythe for the restarted CG method. We point out that usually such a behavior does not exist in restarted Krylov subspace method for nonsymmetric matrices which use only $A$ (and not $A^T$); see~\\cite{VecLan11}\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

It is \nthus important to calculate the CMB anisotropies for a given\nmodel simply and reliably.  \n\nThe origin of observed galactic magnetic fields of the order of\n $\\mu$Gauss is still unknown. For some time it has been\nbelieved that tiny seed fields can be amplified by a non-linear galactic dynamo\nmechanism. The effectiveness of this process has recently been\nstrongly questioned, however \\cite{critics}. If magnetic fields are\nnot substantially amplified by non-linear effects, but have just\ncontracted with the cosmic plasma during galaxy formation, primordial \nfields of the order $10^{-9}$ Gauss on Mega-parsec scales are required\nto induce the observed galactic fields.\n\nIt is interesting to note that a field strength of \n$10^{-8}$Gauss provides an energy density of $\\Omega_B = B^2/(8\\pi\\rho_c) \\sim\n10^{-5}\\Omega_{\\gamma}$, where $\\Omega_{\\gamma}$ is the density parameter in\nphotons. We naively\n expect a  field of this amplitude to induce perturbations\nin the CMB on the order of $10^{-5}$, which is just the level of the\nobserved anisotropies. This leads us to investigate the extent to\nwhich the isotropy of the CMB may constrain primordial magnetic fields.\nIt is clear from our order of magnitude estimate that we shall never be\nable to constrain tiny seed fields on the order of $10^{-13}$Gauss with this\napproach, but primordial fields of $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-8}$Gauss may well have\nleft observable traces in the microwave background.\n\nThis is the question we investigate quantitatively in this paper.\nSome work on the influence of primordial magnetic fields on CMB\nanisotropies has already\nbeen published, particularly the cases of fast magneto-sonic waves and\nthe gravitational effects of a constant magnetic field\n\\cite{Ad,BFS,Barrow}. Here we study Alfv\\'en waves. \nWe leave aside the problem of generation of primordial magnetic fields.\nThis issue is addressed {\\em e.g.} in \\cite{Veneziano,GS}.\n\nThe possible influence of magnetic fields on large scale structure \nformation has been investigated in \\cite{Olinto} and references therein. \n\nThe paper is organized as follows.\nIn Section~2 we discuss the effect of a homogeneous magnetic field\nbackground on the cosmic plasma.\nBoth scalar (potential, or fast and slow magneto-sonic waves) and\nvorticity  (Alfv\\'en) waves can be induced.

The influence of the\nmagneto-sonic waves can be interpreted as a slight change in the speed\n of sound, and\nhas been investigated in \\cite{Ad}. In Section~4 we present our conclusions.\nSome of the more technical computations as well as a discussion of Silk\ndamping of vector perturbations are left to two appendices.\n\n{\\bf Notation:} For simplicity we concentrate on the case\n$\\Omega_0=1$.

For example, the following tweet ``\\textit{\\textbf{A disruption in bus service in Gold Coast} due to \\textbf{lack of communication between translink and event organizers}}\" contains two causally related events. From this tweet it can be said that the ``lack of communication\" was a cause of transport service disruption in Gold Coast. This information could be applied in prescriptive analytics by the decision makers to reduce the chance of a future transport disruption during public gatherings. Causality information can also be applied to improve automated \\textit{why} question answering. For example, we can answer the question ``Why Sally Pearson is not participating today?\" from the event causality information extracted from the following tweet, ``\\textit{\\textbf{A knee injury} caused \\textbf{Sally Pearson to quit the competition}}\". The uses of the above event causalities in predictive event analytics based applications are visualized in Fig. \\ref{fig:app-scenerios}. \n   \n      \\begin{figure}\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{app_scenario.pdf}\n        \\vspace{-1ex}\n        \\caption{Application of automatic event causality detection in \\emph{why} question answering and predictive event analysis}        \n        \\label{fig:app-scenerios}\n        \\vspace{-3ex}\n    \\end{figure}\n   \n  \nThe extraction of causal relationships is an evolving area of research \\cite{Blanco2008, Do2011, Ciresan2012, Riaz2013, Riaz2014, Mirza2014, Luo2016, Kruengkrai2017}. Existing approaches often apply linguistic rules or commonsense knowledge to identify causal relationship from short text. However, processing tweets is more challenging than normal short text \\cite{Ritter2011}. One of the most obvious challenges is that tweets are unstructured and highly informal in nature. Hence, the linguistic rule-based approaches \\cite{Luo2016, Sasaki2017}, which depend on grammatical correctness of text, perform poorly on tweets (see section \\ref{sec:experiments}). Additionally, the causally related event pairs appear infrequently in tweets and the causal relationship between events lacks context information. Due to this lack of adequate context information, supervised learning based approaches such as \\cite{Ponti2017} are not much effective on tweets\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

For this reason, it is desirable to understand the language of emotion and develop tools to aid such an understanding. Although there has been recently works focusing on detecting human emotion from text data ~\\cite{volkova2016inferring,abdul2017emonet,alhuzali2018enabling}, we still lack a deeper understanding of various components related to emotion. Available emotion detection tools have so far been based on theories of basic emotion like the work of Paul Ekman and colleagues (e.g., ~\\cite{ekman1992argument}) and extensions of these (e.g., Robert Plutchik's models ~\\cite{plutchik1994psychology}). Emotion theory, however, has more to offer than mere categorization of human experience based on valence (e.g., anger, joy, sadness). As such, computational treatment of emotion is yet to benefit from existing (e.g., psychological) theories by building models that capture nuances these theories offer. Our work focuses on the cognitive appraisal theory ~\\cite{roseman1984cognitive} where Roseman posits the existence of 5 appraisal components, including that of `agency'. Agency refers to whether a stimuli is caused by the individual, \\textit{self-caused}, another individual, \\textit{other-caused}, or merely the result of the situation \\textit{circumstance-caused}. Identifying the exact type of agency related to an emotion is useful in that it helps determine the target of emotion (i.e., another person or some other type of entity). We focus on agency since it was recently labeled as an extension of the HappyDB dataset ~\\cite{asai2018happydb} as part of the CL-Aff shared task~\\cite{overview_claff}~\\footnote{\\url{https://sites.google.com/view/affcon2019/cl-aff-shared-task}}. \n\nThe CL-Aff shared task distribution of HappyDB also includes labels for the concept of `sociality'.

Later, it built a swap station in Harris Ranch, Calif., halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, to test the technology.\n\nBut there\u2019s a problem, Tesla CEO Elon Musk says: Customers aren\u2019t interested.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t care about pack swap,\u201d Musk said Tuesday at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting. Tesla\u2019s proprietary Superchargers, which can top off the battery in the Model S with 200 miles of range in about 20 minutes, are \u201cfast enough\u201d for most customers, he said, and unlike battery swaps, they\u2019re free.\n\n\u201cWe thought people would prefer Supercharging, but we weren\u2019t sure,\u201d Musk said. \u201cSo that\u2019s why we built the pack swap capability in. And based on what we\u2019re seeing here, it\u2019s unlikely to be something that\u2019s worth expanding in the future unless something changes.\u201d\n\nWith this public reversal by Musk, battery swapping, once a promising alternative to fast charging, now seems destined to become a quirky footnote in the history of Tesla, and perhaps the entire electric-car movement.\n\nBattery swapping was in vogue when Tesla was designing and engineering the Model S. Better Place, an Israeli startup, raised $750 million in venture capital to prove the concept, and had 200 employees at a headquarters right near Tesla\u2019s offices in Palo Alto. But in 2013, the company left the U.S., and then went bankrupt.\n\nThat same year, Tesla signaled it was committed to battery-swapping. In June 2013, the company held an event at its design studio in Hawthorne, Calif., where it demonstrated a pack being swapped in 90 seconds.\n\nRicardo Reyes, vice president of communications at Tesla, said the company subsequently invited Model S owners in California to use Tesla\u2019s Harris Ranch swap center during road trips. Few accepted the offer, and even fewer were repeat customers, he said in an interview Tuesday in Palo Alto.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been limited use by the people we\u2019ve invited,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cThey say: \u2018that was a cool experience, but I\u2019m going to go back to Supercharging.\u201d\n\nIn the heyday of excitement about battery charging, Tesla also had a strong financial incentive to make the technology work.\n\nTesla makes tens of millions of dollars per quarter by selling zero-emission vehicle credits awarded by the California Air Resources Board, which requires a share of cars automakers sell in the state to be electric vehicles. It\u2019s a small and shrinking share of Tesla\u2019s revenue -- about 5 percent nowadays -- but money is money.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, Tesla was able to claim about 75 percent more credits -- up to 7 credits per Model S instead of 4 credits per Model S -- under a fast-refueling provision that regulators had written in an attempt to give extra credit to hydrogen cars.

Introduction}\n\n\nThis paper has two main goals:  the first is to construct the invariant vector fields and one-forms on $SU(3)$ in Euler coordinates that are similar to the Euler angle parameters of $SU(3)$; the second is the application of these structures to the description of the geometric phases of three state systems.\n\nThe Euler coordinates along with the left and right invariant vector fields and one-forms are constructed here for several reasons.  One, the Euler decomposition of a group element is achieved by a method that is very general and could, in principle, be applied to $SU(n)$.  Two, this particular parameterization is convenient for many calculations as will be shown.  Three, there will be advantages to having a set of invariant vector fields and corresponding one-forms in the same parameterization of the group. \n\nColor \\cite{W}, flavor \\cite{efw}, and nuclear models \\cite{Elliot} use the group $SU(3)$.  However, geometric aspects of the group manifold have not emphasized.  That is not to say that the differential geometric structures are not relevant to these models; indeed they are!  However, as shown in Refs. \\cite{m1}, and \\cite{m2}, the differential geometry of $SU(3)$ is an integral part of the description of three state systems.  The Euler coordinates \\cite{note1} and differential forms provide a complete description of the differential geometry needed to describe the pure state density matrix and geometric phase \\cite{snw} of three state systems.\n\n\\section*{II.  The Lie Algebra}\n\nThe Lie Algebra of a Lie group is a set of left invariant vector fields on the group manifold.  These can be constructed by a method that has been applied to $SU(2)$ (see for example \\cite{lb}).  The method for decomposing a group element into Euler coordinates and the method for constructing the left invariant vector fields can in principle be applied to $SU(n)$.  Here we provide the details for $SU(3)$.\n\n\\subsection*{II.1.  Euler Decomposition}\n\nTo parameterize the group into the ``Euler angle'' type parameterization, or Euler coordinates, we first consider the Lie algebra of the group.  The algebra obeys the following commutation relations:\n$$\n\\left[ \\lambda_i, \\lambda_j \\right] = iC^k_{\\;ij} \\lambda_k.\n$$\nThe structure constants, $C^k_{\\;ij}$, can be chosen totally antisymmetric in the three indices.  Then the distinction between upper and lower indices is not relevant (One may also use the Killing metric to lower the index).  In the usual, Gell-Mann basis, the non-zero structure constants are given by:\n$$\nC_{123} = 2, \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; C_{458} = C_{678}= \\sqrt{3},\n$$\n$$\nC_{147} = C_{246} = C_{257} = C_{345} = C_{516} = C_{637} = 1.\n$$\nWe can use the Cartan decomposition and split the Lie algebra of $SU(3)$, denoted here ${\\cal L}(SU(3))$, into a Lie subalgebra ${\\cal L}(K)$ and the set of all other $SU(3)$ Lie algebra elements ${\\cal U}(P)$\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

Based on the information given so far, can you tell me what might be the main mechanism responsible for the observed pulsations in IGR J16320-4751, and how does it differ from other known pulsating X-ray binaries?\nAnswer:Step 1: Understanding the phenomenon of pulsations in X-ray binaries\nPulsations are periodic variations in X-ray luminosity seen from some types of compact objects like neutron stars and black holes, which could result from changes in their underlying magnetic field configuration. These fluctuations typically last between several milliseconds up to minutes depending on the object's spin rate.\nStep 2: Differences among various types of pulsators\na) Rotational Pulsars - They emit radio waves as well as X-rays due to rotation, and these pulses correspond to the rotational frequency (spin). Their X-ray emission varies because the emitting region expands and contracts during each revolution. In this case, the X-ray pulsar appears to pulse at its spin frequency.\nb) Magnetospheric cyclotron maser engines (MCMEs) - Accreting magnetized neutron stars possess strong magnetic fields that power jets through relativistic electron-cyclotron masers.

The originally \\SI{5x5x1}{\\mm} crystal was broken into two halves along a diagonal (see SI). The sample was prepared by removing magnetic contamination (presumably resulting from the polishing process) with a \\SI{100}{\\s} ArCl$_2$ plasma etch (ICP-RIE, Sentech) in \\SI{2}{\\s} steps. One side of the crystal was then spin coated with an HSQ layer (FOx, Dow Corning) and subsequently developed using electron-beam lithography to create \\SI{10x2}{\\um} mesa masks. These mask patterns were transferred into the sample with a \\SI{100}{\\s} ArCl$_2$ plasma etch. The masks were then removed using HF. This process results in the \\SI{166}{\\nm}-tall structures seen in the inset of Fig.~\\ref{fig:Sample}a. For the measurements, the sample was mounted on a small Peltier element, placed on top of an open-loop, piezoelectric scanner (Attocube ANSxyz100), allowing us to heat the sample up to $\\approx$\\SI{340}{K}.\n\n\\subsection{NV Magnetometry}\nThe NV center is a point defect in diamond, whose S=1 electronic ground state spin can be initialized and read-out through optical excitation at \\SI{532}{\\nm}. Specifically, we use state-dependent fluorescence to identify the Zeeman splitting between the $\\ket{\\pm1}$ spin levels using optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR).\nAll measurements in this study were performed using scanning, all-diamond parabolic pillars~\\cite{Hedrich2020a} housing a single NV center and integrated into a custom confocal imaging setup equipped with a CW \\SI{532}{\\nm} laser~\\cite{Grinolds2013}. The measurements were performed with $<$\\SI{10}{\\uW} of continuous-wave optical excitation, a factor of two smaller than typical saturation powers for NVs in these parabolic scanning pillars~\\cite{Hedrich2020a}. The microwave (MW) needed to manipulate the NV is provided by a \\SI{30}{\\um} gold loop antenna with a typical effective driving strength of \\SI{0.25}{G} at the NV. These low excitation powers (both MW and laser) ensure that we do not disturb the DW, which was confirmed by repeating scans and observing the DW. A small bias magnetic field ($<$\\SI{60}{G}) was applied along the NV axis using a permanent magnet to allow for a sign-sensitive measurement of the stray magnetic fields. \n\nBoth 2D magnetic field images and linescans were performed using a feedback technique to lock a microwave driving frequency to the instantaneous NV spin transition frequency, as described in~\\cite{Schoenfeld2011}. We employ single-pixel integration times ranging from \\SI{0.3}{\\s} for full-field images to \\SI{5}{\\s} for individual line scans with a noise floor of $\\approx$~\\SI{3.3}{\\micro\\tesla}$/\\sqrt{\\textrm{Hz}}$.\n\n\\subsection{Domain Wall Nucleation}\nDWs are nucleated in the otherwise mono-domain single crystal Cr$_2$O$_3${} using magnetoelectric cooling through the N\\'eel temperature. A uniform magnetic field is achieved by placing two \\SI{5x5}{\\cm} permanent magnets adjacent to each other and in close proximity to the sample. The result is a nearly homogeneous magnetic field of $B\\approx550~$mT along the center normal, as measured by a Hall probe (AS NTM, FM302 Teslameter, Projekt Elektronik). In addition, we apply electric fields across the sample using a split-gate capacitor consisting of two quartz plates with \\SI{100}{\\nm} Au evaporated onto the surface. \nThe Cr$_2$O$_3${} sample is then centered onto the capacitor gap and sandwiched between the top and bottom gate together with thin mica sheets to prevent electroplating of Au onto the crystal surface. A schematic of this setup may be found in the SI. The whole device is then heated to far above the N\\'eel temperature and allowed to cool to room temperature while simultaneously applying $\\pm$\\SI{750}{V} between the electrodes leading to an electric field of $E\\approx$ \\SI{0.75}{MV/m} across the crystal\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

Lie himself had proved the integrability to \\emph{local} Lie groups; the full version was obtained by \\'{E}lie Cartan \\cite{car:the,car:tro}. Classical textbook proofs \nobtain Lie's Third Theorem as a consequence of rather difficult structure theorems in Lie theory; a more elementary argument was given by Gorbatsevich \\cite{gor:con}. \n\nFollowing the introduction of Lie algebroids by Pradines \\cite{pra:th,pra:tro} in the late 1960s, the generalization of Lie's Third Theorem to the integration of Lie algebroids $A\\Rightarrow M$ to Lie groupoids $G\\rightrightarrows M$ was an open question for many years. (See Section \\ref{sec:basics} below for some background material on Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids.)\nIn special cases, such as tangent bundles to foliations, actions of Lie algebras on manifolds, or  smooth families of Lie algebras, the integrability was established through explicit constructions.  \nA counter-example, disproving integrability in the general case, was given by Almeida and Molino \\cite{alm:sui} in 1985. These authors observed that the Lie algebroid $TM\\times \\mathbb{R}\\Rightarrow M$, with bracket on sections\n\\[ [X+f,Y+g]=[X,Y]+L_X g-L_Y f+\\sigma(X,Y)\\]\ndefined by a closed 2-form $\\sigma\\in \\Omega^2(M)$, cannot integrate to \na Lie groupoid unless the subgroup of spherical periods \n\\[ \\Lambda= \\big\\{\\int_{S^2}f^*\\sigma\\big|\\  f\\colon S^2\\to M\\big\\}\\subset \\mathbb{R}\\] \nis discrete.  Using a \\v{C}ech-theoretic argument, Mackenzie \\cite{mac:gen} generalized this obstruction to more general transitive Lie algebroids (that is, having a surjective anchor map $\\a\\colon A\\to TM$). For cotangent Lie algebroids of Poisson manifolds $(M,\\pi)$, Catteneo-Felder \\cite{cat:poi} used an infinite-dimensional symplectic quotient to \nconstruct a topological groupoid which, when smooth, would be a symplectic groupoid integrating $T^*M\\Rightarrow M$.  \nIn his talk at the conference `Poisson 2000' in Luminy, \\v{S}evera \\cite{sev:so} proposed a topological groupoid $G\\rightrightarrows M$ associated to arbitrary Lie algebroids $A\\Rightarrow M$, as the space of Lie algebroid paths $\\gamma\\colon \\mathsf{I}\\to A$ modulo Lie algebroid homotopies, but did not make precise under what conditions $G$ is smooth. Independently, a similar idea was suggested by Weinstein  (see comments in \\cite{cra:lect}), motivated by the new proof of Lie's Third Theorem by Duistermaat-Kolk \\cite{du:li}. The full picture was obtained by Crainic-Fernandes  \\cite{cra:intlie}, who gave a careful discussion of the smoothness properties of the topological groupoid $G\\rightrightarrows M$, introduced the so-called \\emph{monodromy groups}, and \nproved  that uniform discreteness of these groups is both necessary and sufficient for smoothness.\n\nThe construction of $G\\rightrightarrows M$ as the   space of Lie algebroid paths modulo Lie algebroid homotopy is conceptually satisfying, but can be hard to work with in practice, due to technical difficulties with  infinite-dimensional manifolds, and since the concept of Lie algebroid homotopy is somewhat involved.  It is the purpose of this note to show that in the special case of transitive Lie algebroids, a rather elementary proof of the Crainic-Fernandes  theorem is available. \nOur construction of an integration is quite direct, and is more geometric than that given in Mackenzie's work \\cite{mac:gen}. The basic idea is to adapt the re-construction of a principal bundle with connection  from its parallel transport (holonomies) \\cite{bar:hol,cae:fam,col:par,sch:par}. \n\nLet us give an overview of the construction. We start with a geometric interpretation of the Crainic-Fernandes monodromy groups. Recall that the clutching construction identifies the isomorphism classes of principal $K$-bundles over 2-spheres with elements of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(K,e)$. We show that, similarly, transitive Lie algebroids over $S^2$, with structure Lie algebra $\\k$, \nare classified by elements of  $\\operatorname{Cent}(\\widetilde{K})$, \nthe center of the connected, simply connected Lie group  integrating $\\k$. Given a transitive Lie algebroid $A\\Rightarrow M$, \nwith isotropy algebras $\\lie{h}_m,\\ m\\in M$, we obtain the monodromy groups $\\Lambda_m\\subset \\operatorname{Cent}(\\widetilde{H}_m)$ as the set of elements classifying the pullback Lie algebroids $f^!A\\Rightarrow S^2$, for all maps $f\\colon S^2\\to M$ taking the base point \n$m_0\\in S^2$ \nto $m$. The same argument as  in \\cite{alm:sui} shows that discreteness of $\\Lambda_m$ is necessary for existence of an integration\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

The use of edge computing in microgrids can improve the reliability and stability of the power grid by distributing tasks among local controllers.\n2. Edge computing can reduce computational and communication complexities in microgrids.\n3. The use of edge computing can enable real-time operation of microgrids, which is crucial for maintaining the stability of the power grid.\nAnswer:What are some potential challenges or limitations of implementing edge computing in microgrids?\n\nOne potential challenge of implementing edge computing in microgrids could be the need for robust and reliable communication networks to ensure seamless real-time operation. The availability and reliability of network connections can impact the effectiveness of distributing tasks among local controllers. Additionally, there may be concerns regarding data security and privacy when deploying edge computing solutions in microgrids. Adequate measures would need to be implemented to protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access. Overall, while edge computing offers numerous benefits for microgrid operations, addressing these challenges is essential for successful implementation.\nQuestion:Here is an inquiry: What makes distributed control systems in power grid more reliable than traditional centralized control systems?\n\nThere are several reasons why distributed control systems (DCS) can be more reliable than traditional centralized control systems (CCS) in a power grid:\n\n1. **Seamless Real-Time Operation**: In DCS, decisions can be made by local controllers within the microgrid, allowing for seamless, real-time responses to any fluctuations or failures. On the other hand, CCS typically requires all decision-making to occur at a central hub which may cause delays due to the time it takes for information to travel from various parts of the system.\n\n2. **No Single Point of Failure**: With no single point of failure, distributed systems have built-in redundancy, ensuring that the system will continue to function even if one part fails. In contrast, if the central controller fails in a CCS, the entire system could shut down.\n\n3. **Reduced Computational and Communication Complexities**: The distribution of tasks among local controllers helps reduce computational complexity because each local controller only needs to handle small subsystems. Additionally, as communication is kept locally, there\u2019s less risk of data corruption or signal degradation over large distances, leading to reduced communication complexities.\n\n4. **Load Balancing**: Local control also enables load balancing in real-time, distributing energy demand more effectively throughout the network compared to a CCS where the overall picture must first pass through the main station. This ensures smoother and potentially faster recovery from fluctuations.\nAnswer:1. Seamless real-time operation\n2. No single point of failure\n3. Reduction in computational and communication complexities\n4. Distribution of tasks among local controllers in the microgrid\n5. Load balancing in real-time\n6. Smoother and potentially faster recovery from fluctuations.\nQuestion:Based on the preceding context and previous questions, a relevant and insightful question might be:\n'How do distributed control systems in power grids manage to maintain stability despite having multiple control points?'\n\nDistributed control systems in power grids are able to maintain stability despite having multiple control points because they use advanced algorithms that take into account data from various sensors throughout the grid. These algorithms analyze real-time information about voltage levels, current flows, and other important parameters at each substation or transmission line segment. By continuously monitoring these metrics, DCS can quickly identify any issues arising due to changes in load demand or network topology shifts caused by faults such as short circuits or broken lines. When needed, local controllers within specific microgrids will adjust their output voltages accordingly so as not only ensure stable operating conditions but also optimize energy efficiency through efficient resource allocation across different parts of the overall system.'\nAnswer:* Advanced algorithms that consider real-time data from multiple sensors\n* Continuous monitoring of voltage levels, current flows, and other important parameters\n* Identification of issues arising from changes in load demand or network topology shifts\n* Adjustment of local controller output voltages for stable operation and optimal energy efficiency\n\nQuestion:The key takeaways from the text are:\n\n1.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Topical phase of matters have recently gained much attentions from physicists due to their novel properties. Many researches have tried to find new topologically non-trivial states of matter through experimental verification or numerical simulations. Theoreticians also studied about how these exotic behaviors arise from underlying microscopic Hamiltonians with certain symmetries called \"topological\" ones. There exist two kinds of symmetries; one is the site-dependent ones like TRS(time reversal symmetry), PHS(particle hole symmetry), CS(Chiral Symmetry). These onsite symmetries were used to construct so-called 'periodic tables'. On the contrary, there exists another type of symmetry called \"Crystal\" symmetry. This paper will review what we know until now about gapless systems in terms of Crystal symmetry and its application to practical problems.\nPrevious Question \nQuestion:just ask! \nWhat is the main topic of this passage?\nThe main topic of this passage is the study of gapless systems in terms of crystal symmetry and its practical applications. \nWhat are some potential benefits of understanding gapless systems?\nSome potential benefits of understanding gapless systems include:\n1. Improved understanding of materials properties: Gapless systems can provide valuable insights into the behavior of materials at different temperatures and pressures, which can help scientists develop new materials with unique properties.\n2. Enhanced sensitivity to external stimuli: Gapless systems may be more sensitive to external stimuli such as light or electric fields, which could lead to innovations in areas like photonics or electronics.\n3. Better control over reactions: By controlling the gaplessness of a material, researchers may be able to better control chemical reactions and processess, potentially leading to advancements in fields like catalysis or energy storage.\n4. Increased efficiency in energy conversion: Gapless materials could potentially improve the efficiency of energy conversion processes,\nAnswer:What is the goal of investigating gapped systems?\nThe goal of investigating gapped systems is to gain a deeper understanding of their electronic properties and behavior in order to find new materials or design specific materials with desirable properties like higher electronic energy gaps for thermoelectrics or magnetic energy gaps as potential spin-based materials, and hence use these systems to create functional devices or improve current technologies.\nQuestion:How do topologically non-trivial states of matter differ from traditional topological insulators?\nTopologically non-trivial states of matter, such as those studied in gapless systems, have unique properties that distinguish them from traditional topological insulators. Instead of relying on the existence of band gaps in the energy spectrum, these states persist even in the presence of disorder. Additionally, they exhibit exotic phenomena such as quantum anomalous Hall effect and fractional excitations, which are not seen in traditional topological insulators. These properties make them promising candidates for use in high-performance electronic and energy storage devices.\nAnswer:Given below is an essay prompt:\n\"In recent years, many people have been interested in studying gapless systems because it has been found that the physics of these systems differs significantly from that of conventional insulating materials.\"\nYour task is to write a response to the given essay prompt.

This low-rank representation allows us to approximate the expensive simulation process at each time step without having to store all the necessary information.\"\nPrevious Question \nQuestion:Here is a question. What is the key contribution of this paper?\nThe answer is as follows. The key contribution of the paper is the development of an accelerated surrogate modeling method for simulating complex systems using high-dimensional data and multiple scales. This method combines ideas from compressive sensing and machine learning to efficiently construct a low-rank approximation of the forward operator between the input space and output space. This low-rank representation allows for the approximation of the expensive simulation process without having to store all the necessary information.\nAnswer:1. What are some features that make this method unique?\nThe proposed method is unique because it combines two different fields, compressive sensing and machine learning, which typically do not intersect each other often. Compressive sensing deals with sparse signal recovery while machine learning focuses on model fitting based on data. By combining these two approaches, they can create a more efficient approach towards simulating complex systems using high-dimensional data at multiple scales. The key contribution lies in constructing a low-rank approximation of the forward operator between input space and output space to minimize computational costs without having to store all necessary information about every possible state during simulation. This allows for faster processing times compared to traditional methods while still maintaining accuracy due to the reduced dimensionality achieved through this technique.\n2. How does it work?\nThe method works by first defining an objective function that penalizes deviations from a given target distribution over time steps or spatial locations within the system's state space. Then, they apply compressive sensing principles to reduce the number of measurements required per time step or location by estimating only those coefficients in the low-rank representation needed to reconstruct the full operator matrix accurately.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": ""}, {"role": "user", "content": "\\section{Introduction}\n\nThe physics driving the empirically established dependence of most galaxy properties on their environment is still poorly constrained \\citep{Boselli&Gavazzi2006, ParkHwang2009, BoselliGavazzi2014}. Ram-pressure stripping \\citep{Gunn&Gott1972, Quilis2000, Vollmer2001, Bekki&Couch2003} is often invoked to explain the observations of gas-deficient galaxies or galaxies with irregular appearance in clusters \\citep{KenneyvanGorkom&Vollmer2004, Chung2007, Poggianti2017, Jachym2019, Ebeling2019}. It has also been successfully shown to explain the distribution, in projected phase-space, of passive galaxies in clusters \\citep{Jaffe2016, Yoon2017, Jaffe2018}. However, because its strength depends on galaxies moving at high relative velocities through a relatively dense gas, ram-pressure stripping is only expected to be efficient in massive clusters of galaxies. In reality the distribution of galaxy properties throughout the large-scale structure of the universe requires a complex combination of multiple physical mechanisms. Some of the galaxies are quenched well before they find their way to the interiors of clusters \\citep{Bianconi2018}. At low redshifts, approximately 40\\% of the galaxies residing outside clusters show no ongoing star formation \\citep{Balogh1999,Verdugo2008}, a fact which cannot be explained with ram-pressure stripping. A collective term, pre-processing, is often used to explain the presence of this passive population and includes a number of physical mechanisms acting on galaxies residing in smaller haloes or filaments. Most likely starvation is the mechanism responsible for this \\citep{Larson1980, Balogh2000, Bekki2002, Goto2003} as it is capable of affecting a large fraction of all the galaxies, the ones that are satellites in a larger halo but not necessarily in a cluster of galaxies. Starvation is the absence of accretion of fresh gas onto galaxies that can be used for star formation. It has been shown that the star formation histories of the passive galaxies in the local universe are consistent with starvation being the main mechanism responsible for quenching their star formation \\citep{Peng2015}. \\citet{Einasto2014} showed that the fraction of passive galaxies in groups increases with group richness, and that the environment in which the groups reside modulates this trend. There are also other mechanisms that can alter the star formation properties of galaxies in lower density environments \\citep{Cowie&Songaila1977, Fujita2004}. Thus, galaxies that have been pre-processed undergo little change when they reach the interiors of massive clusters. Other galaxies, likely individual, only stop forming stars when they cross the virial radius of a cluster and are observed as jellyfish galaxies \\citep{Poggianti2017}. In addition, high-density environments, be it groups, clusters, or non-virialised structures like filaments, are associated not only with quenching, but sometimes also with an increase in star formation \\citep{Fujita&Nagashima1999, HwangLee2009, Stroe2015a, Deshev2017, Vulcani2019}.\n\nAbell 963 (hereafter A963) is one of the best studied clusters outside the local universe. It has been targeted with XMM-Newton, Galex, Spitzer, and the LMT \\citep{Cybulski2016}. The cluster has been observed in the optical with the Isaac Newton Telescope, and virtually all of its members brighter than R$\\leq$19 have been targeted for optical spectroscopy \\citet[hereafter J16]{Jaffe2016}. A963 is one of only two clusters outside the local universe for which we have 21cm data, a result of a blind interferometric survey with the WSRT called BUD{\\sc Hi}ES \\citep[][Gogate et al. \\textit{MNRAS accepted}]{Verheijen2007, Deshev2009}. The cluster and its constituent galaxies have been extensively studied \\citep[J16]{Jaffe2013}. The projected phase-space analysis of A963 presented in J16 explains to a remarkable extent the distribution of the galaxies with different properties residing in this cluster, and confirms the important role of ram-pressure stripping as the reason for the high passive fraction of cluster galaxies. However, the projected phase-space analysis, particularly when applied to individual clusters, ignores part of the information contained in the data, like possible deviations from spherical symmetry of the cluster and anisotropic accretion of galaxies\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

Such errors cannot usually be corrected \\textit{ex post facto} due to the autoregressive structure of the model, and can substantially affect downstream steps as we find that model likelihoods are highly sensitive to even the most minor of perturbations.\n\nScore-based diffusion models \\cite{song2020score,ho2020denoising} offer a different perspective on the data generation process.

The resistance flattens below 5 K, indicating a metallic surface state. Despite ongoing debates about the origin and topological nature of the surface states, SmB6 remains an attractive candidate for applications due to its robustness against disorder and its intrinsic bulk gap. Recent studies have also revealed interesting transient behavior in SmB6, highlighting the need for further research into its frequency-dependent transport properties.\nPrevious Question \nQuestion:Here's an inquiry: What makes SmB6 particularly resilient against disorder compared to other materials? \nHere's the reply: Studies suggest that SmB6 has strong electronic correlation between samarium and bismuth atoms, which helps protect it from local perturbations like impurities or defects. This leads to higher stability and conductivity even near room temperature, making it more durable than similar compounds.\nAnswer:What is the main point of the passage?: The main point being made in this passage is that Samarium hexaboride (SmB6) is a robust and resilient material against disorder due to its strong electronic correlation between the samarium and bismuth atoms, making it more stable and conductive even near room temperature compared to similar compounds.\nQuestion:Here's an inquiry: What implications do the \"frequency-dependent transport properties\" mentioned in the text have for the development of future technologies using SmB6? And how might these transient behaviors be harnessed or controlled?\n\nReply: These frequency-dependent transport properties could potentially lead to novel electronic devices and applications. For example, SmB6's ability to switch between metallic and insulating states under different frequencies could be used in tunable electronic circuits or fast switching memory devices. Additionally, understanding and controlling these transient behaviors may unlock new ways to manipulate the material's properties for other applications such as quantum computing or spintronics.\nAnswer:Here is a task: Explain why SmB6 has garnered attention from scientists despite being a relatively unknown material. Here is the solution: SmB6 has gained prominence among scientists due to its unique combination of characteristics - it is both a strong correlation insulator and a metallic conductor at low temperatures. This duality makes it an exciting material for exploring fundamental physics concepts like quantum mechanics and electron behavior. Furthermore, its resilience against disorder makes it highly desirable for potential applications in electronics and quantum computing.\nQuestion:Here is an inquiry: What are some potential applications of SmB6?\n\nHere is the reply: Some potential applications of SmB6 include electronics, spintronics, quantum computing, and as a material for catalytic reactions. It has unique electronic and magnetic properties which make it attractive for these applications. However, more research is needed to fully understand its potential uses.\nAnswer:Here is an inquiry: How does SmB6 exhibit its strong correlation?\n\nHere is the reply: Strong coupling between electrons in SmB6 leads to the formation of a complex lattice of atoms that act together, resulting in what's known as a strongly correlated system. This interplay can cause unusual behaviors such as superconductivity or magnetism even when conditions are favorable for neither. In simpler terms, this \"correlation\" is what makes SmB6 behave differently than expected based solely on individual particle properties.\n\nQuestion:* SmB6 is a complex lattice of atoms that exhibits strong coupling between electrons\n* This strong coupling leads to unusual behaviors such as superconductivity or magnetism\n* These behaviors are not expected based solely on individual particle properties\n* SmB6 is a promising material for exploring fundamental physics concepts and potential applications in electronics and quantum computing.\nAnswer the question step by step and explain your thoughts.

Unlike traditional methods that provide a single approximation, Yamamoto's method provides multiple approximations, resulting in a more accurate approximation of the original function. \n\nCan you explain the concept of interpolation and how it is used in mathematical applications? \n\nInterpolation is a mathematical method used to approximate a function by fitting it to a set of given data points. It involves estimating the values of the function between the given data points,\nAnswer:The concept of interpolation refers to the estimation of unknown values of a function based on known information about the function. In mathematics, this can be done using various techniques such as polynomial interpolation, spline interpolation, and neural networks. Interpolation has numerous practical applications in fields like science, engineering, finance, and medicine where functions need to be estimated from limited observations. For example, in physics, interpolated curves may represent physical phenomena that cannot be directly measured but can be inferred from experimental results. Similarly, in economics, interpolated models may predict economic trends based on historical data. Overall, interpolation plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between theory and observation, enabling scientists and engineers to make informed decisions and predictions.  \n\nIn addition to its use in mathematics, interpolation also finds application in computer graphics and image processing. Here, it is employed to create images or animations that simulate real-world scenes or objects. By interpolating between different frames or pixels, one can produce smooth transitions and avoid jagged edges or artifacts. This technique is widely used in video games, movies, and virtual reality simulations.   \n\nAnother area where interpolation is applied is signal processing. Here, it\nQuestion:in \\cite{Yamamoto}.

These observations aimed to study the stellar populations of early-type galaxies. The images were taken in several ultraviolet bands. A point-like source was observed at the center of two of the galaxies, with a significant increase in luminosity in the $U$ band between the two epochs. This increase was interpreted as a flare, possibly due to accretion onto a central massive black hole.

The most prevalent type of NER is in-domain recognition, in which the model is trained on a well-studied domain that contains a large amount of labeled data such as news and also evaluated on texts from the same domain.\n\nHowever, it is common that texts might originate from different domains and we need to perform NER well on a new domain \\cite{lee2018transfer}. But retraining the model on the target domain is not necessarily an option since labeled data of good quality can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to obtain. Label scarcity is especially pronounced for patient note de-identification, the task of removing protected health information from medical notes. Tuning NER systems to perform well in a new domain by hand is possible, but requires significant effort and is often not feasible \\cite{lee2018transfer}. In this scenario, we have to resort to cross-domain NER. Having a system that can perform well on domains where labeled data is scarce or even non-existing would be extremely valuable.\n\nWe propose ZERO, a model that  performs zero-shot or few-shot learning in NER with external knowledge. The external knowledge comes in the form of word embeddings originating from either GloVe or Conceptnet Numberbatch \\cite{sennington2014glove,speer2019ensemble,speer2017conceptnet}.\n\nWe obtain word embeddings for each label as well as entity representations from LUKE (Language Understanding with Knowledge-based Embeddings) for each token in the sentences \\cite{yamada2020luke}. For each entity, we calculate dot products for all possible entity-label pairs and obtain the corresponding probabilities for these pairs. The label with the highest probability will be the output label. This enables us to obtain a probability value directly from the pre-trained embeddings rather than relying on having learned the labels during training.\n\nThe main contributions of our work are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item ZERO would allow training a well-performing NER model without any labeled examples in target domains which saves efforts and expenses on labeling.\n    \\item ZERO outperforms LUKE in few-shot learning. When there are only a few samples in the target domain, ZERO serves as a better choice to accomplish the NER tasks.\n    \\item We find that the KL divergence is inversely correlated with ZERO's performance and can be used to estimate how well it will perform on a given source-target domain transfer.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Related work}\n\n\\subsection{LUKE}\nWe use pre-trained LUKE (Language Understanding with Knowledge-based Embeddings) as our backbone architecture \\cite{yamada2020luke}. LUKE is based on a transformer trained on a large amount of entity-annotated corpora obtained from Wikipedia \\cite{vaswani2017attention}. A key difference between LUKE and other contextualized word representations (CWRs) is that LUKE regards both words and entities as independent tokens allowing intermediate and output representations to be computed for all tokens using the transformer (see Figure \\ref{fig:zero}). Since entities are regarded as tokens, LUKE can be used to directly model the relationships between entities.\n\n\n\\subsection{Zero-Shot Learning}\nZero-shot learning is the task of predicting labels not seen during training. Pioneering research on zero-shot learning began in the area of computer vision and used human-engineered features encoded as vectors. These vectors denote the presence or absence of any of the features \\cite{5206772,5206594}. The model then learns a direct mapping between the image features and the class vectors and is able to predict unseen class encodings.\n\n\\subsection{Commonsense Knowledge and Word Embeddings}\nCommonsense knowledge is the type of knowledge that most humans are expected to know about the everyday world, e\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

From the operational point of view this point has to be defined in terms of some properties of a material object and the word ``event'' assumes a meaning which is not purely geometric but is more similar to the meaning it has in the usual language, namely ``something that happens'' in the physical world. A typical event is the collision of two particles. Since the collision of two small particles has a small probability, one may consider, more precisely, in the rest system of the centre-of-mass (CoM), the point which coincides with the CoM when the distance between the two particles reaches its minimum value. This definition of an event makes sense in a classical (non-quantum) theory in the absence of strong gravitational fields, which would complicate the space-time geometry. In the example given above we have considered a ``baricentric event'', which lies on the world line of the CoM of the object that defines it. There are also non-baricentric events: for instance a collision of the first two particles in a system of three particles.  \n\nIf we take into account the quantum properties of the object that defines an event, we have to face some difficult problems. The space-time coordinates $x^{\\alpha}$ $(\\alpha = 0, 1, 2, 3)$ of the event with respect to a classical reference frame have to be considered as quantum observables.

In a power system, supply and demand of electric power must be balanced to keep frequency and voltage close to their nominal values. To maintain this balance, transmission system operators (TSOs) procure ancillary services (AS), e.g., frequency and voltage control, traditionally from conventional generators. With increasing RES shares, the need for AS is also increasing \\cite{makarov_operational_2009}. For this reason, there has been a recent interest in offering AS by flexible loads, which is known as demand response (DR). If properly aggregated, loads can provide AS without environmental impacts and, possibly, more efficiently and at a lower cost compared to generators \\cite{callaway_achieving_2011}.\n\nLoads with thermal storage are suitable for DR because their consumption can be shifted in time without impact on consumer comfort. A lot of research focused on modeling, control, and estimation of large aggregations of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), i.e., small residential loads such as refrigerators, air conditioners, space and water heaters \\cite{kalsi_development_2012,Vrettos2012,Perfumo2012,mathieu_state_2013,VrettosPSCC2014}. The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems of commercial buildings are also interesting for DR because they are large consumers with high thermal inertia, and they usually include a building automation and communication system that facilitates DR implementation \\cite{IREP2013}. Recently, DR applications with commercial buildings has been the topic of several papers some of which are summarized below. The role of information systems and automated model-based control for energy efficiency and DR was discussed in \\cite{pietteLBNL2012}\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

An invertible SPT with purely on-site symmetries in $d$ dimensions generically has gapless  modes on  $d-1$ dimensional boundaries that  respect the protecting symmetries.  These gapless modes are  anomalous in that they cannot be realized in a strictly $d-1$ dimensional system equipped  with the same symmetries, and therefore require the bulk in order  to exist --- a feature often termed the `bulk-boundary correspondence' \\cite{Ryu_2012, Chang_Tse_2014, kapustin2014symmetry, Chang_Tse_2016, Han_2017, Tiwari_2018, Witten_2016, witten_path}. \nOne route to gapping these modes in the absence of a bulk phase transition involves  symmetry breaking, but an additional possibility emerges  on  the two-dimensional (2D) surface of a 3D SPT:  namely, the formation of a non-invertible  2D topological order, enriched by the same symmetries \\cite{Senthil_2013b}.\nThis  necessarily involves interactions, since non-invertible orders are intrinsically interacting. The bulk-boundary correspondence is now  encoded in the fact that the resulting symmetry-enriched topological (SET) order is {\\it also} anomalous: its fractionalized quasiparticles transform under symmetry in a manner that is impossible in a strictly two-dimensional system, but is admissible on the 2D surface of a 3D SPT \\cite{Senthil_2013b, Chen_2014, Bonderson_2013}. A specific example of this is furnished by the 3D TRS invariant topological insulator \\cite{Kane-Mele-2007}. The gapless `surface termination'  that preserves symmetry is a single 2D Dirac fermion, which would violate theorems on `fermion doubling' were it to appear in a purely 2D TRS lattice system \\cite{NIELSEN1981219, Witten_2016, witten_path}. The second, gapped, possibility is the non-invertible $\\mathcal T$-Pfaffian topological order which contains non-Abelian anyonic excitations \\cite{Chen_2014, Bonderson_2013}. Notably, despite respecting TRS $\\mathcal T$, the anyon content of the $\\mathcal T$-Pfaffian requires a non-zero chiral central charge; this is incompatible with $\\mathcal T$-symmetry in a strictly 2D system, but can be realized in a $\\mathcal T$-preserving manner on the 2D surface of the 3DTI. Similar gapped anomalous surface topological orders (STOs) have been proposed for many bosonic and fermionic SPT phases \\cite{Chen_2015, Fidkowski_2013, barkeshli2017, Barkeshli:2016mew, Meng_2018, kobayashi2019gapped, juven_wen_witten, Tachikawa_TRS, Seiberg:2016rsg, juven_wen_witten, maissam_new_1, maissam_new_2} and have been used as the basis of a classification of interacting electronic topological insulators.\n\nThe introduction of spatial symmetries adds richness to the topological classification, allowing the identification of  crystalline \\cite{fu_crystalline, isobe_fu, fu_review, titus_lecture, gauging_crystalline} and `higher order' symmetry-protected topological phases  (HOTPs) of matter~\\cite{benalcazar-bernevig-hughes-prb-2017,Schindlereaat-2018,Yuxuan-2018, Piet-2017, Chen-Fang-2019, Peterson_2018, Serra_Garcia_2018, imhof2018topolectrical, luka_2019, yizhi_hoint_2018, shiozaki_2019, bultinck_2019, Ingham_2020, rasmussen_2020}.
